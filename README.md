YAFF is a frontend library.

In reviewing all the other ones (which are great) we came to the conclusion that another was needed.
One were the intial page load is the fastest yet. One which you will never touch an html file again (html code...well, a little)

What we wanted was a full dynamic front end - independent of any backends, no curly braces, no special added on directives - just speed and functionality.
What we found was yet another front end.
